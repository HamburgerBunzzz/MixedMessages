# MixedMessages

#Intro

The purpose of this randomizer is to assign you with a magical creature. This will include a specific **habitat** and **food** source. As well as what the creature's natural **enemy** is! The message is to be used for entertainment purposes and the guidelines were provided as part of the Mixed Messages portfolio project in the Full Stack career path on Codecademy.

##Languages Used
Currently this message generator is using Javascript to randomly select 1 type, 1 food, and 1 enemy. Each category is in its own array and a function generates the random array item.
